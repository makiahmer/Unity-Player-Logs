# Unity - Player Logs
## Description
Created during my CS Capstone at Oregon State University, this project is an experiment based upon a concept drawn up by our partner team at the University of Washington, to record and chart player meditative experiences over time. To achieve the goal of storing data over time a script interface converts a class to a serialized object and then saves it to a file. The reason there are three identical scenes containing the same GameObject’s is to test data persistence between scenes. The data being persisted is the GameData class, found in the GameController.cs script attached to the “Component Holder” GameObject.

## Highlights
* Data serialization
* Saving and reading from a file
* Object persistence across scenes
* Two input forms and a history form
